# What does it do

Players gain extreme edge boost capabilities and insane movement, similar to Quake but maybe a bit over the top.
It changes everyone's guns so only snipers, mozzy and epg are allowed
Every allowed gun becomes instant kill with EPG and Softball having to hit correctly
Softball and H.E.L.L. is placed in the players 2nd and 3rd slot with Softball being a movement weapon
